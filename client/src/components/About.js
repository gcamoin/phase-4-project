                CulinaryCompass allows users to browse various restaurants within the area 
                as well as leave reviews on restaurants that they have been to. This helps consumers
                make more informed decisions about where they should go to eat and to better understand
                what each restaurant has to offer in terms of food and atmosphere. Not only can users 
                leave reviews on different establishments, but they can also see the average rating
                of each restaurant which is ranked on a scale from 0 to 10.
