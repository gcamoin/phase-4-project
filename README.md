Culinary Compass

Description:

CulinaryCompass allows users to browse various restaurants within the area 
as well as leave reviews on restaurants that they have been to. This helps consumers
make more informed decisions about where they should go to eat and to better understand
what each restaurant has to offer in terms of food and atmosphere. Not only can users 
leave reviews on different establishments, but they can also see the average rating
of each restaurant which is ranked on a scale from 0 to 10.

- Users have the ability to signup for an account and login to an account
